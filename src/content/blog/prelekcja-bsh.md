# Summary

Home appliance manufacturers increase consumer experience by delivering extended value via connected digital services. Examples include companion mobile apps, over-the-air updates of products or integration with 3rd party solutions like smart speakers with voice assistants. Connected home appliances fully integrate into a modern connected home of an IoT world. This poses interesting security challenges throughout the life cycle of the appliance - starting from development, during after sales operations and ending up at decommissioning of the appliance. The presentation will highlight selected security challenges, threats and best practices at BSH, a leading home appliance company in Europe with its global brands: Bosch, Siemens, Gaggenau.
